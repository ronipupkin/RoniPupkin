### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
***I write in English to make it clearer because I write in Visual Studio

My submission contains:
7 HTML pages
1 CSS page
1 JS page

openingScreen page:
The Sign in button does nothing at the moment, because in the next step I can only connect the button to the database and check that the user exists in the system and show him the appropriate screen (if he buys or sells) or an error message if necessary.

SignUp page + ContactUs page _ NewItem page:
Here too the button does nothing at the moment because clicking on it should transfer the data to the database

updateProfile page:
On this page I have currently shown the data manually just for demonstration purposes.
The goal in the next step is that when a user reaches this screen, their data will be retrieved from the database and displayed on this page accordingly.
Clicking the button will verify that the data is correct and save the data again in the database (instead of the previous data).

giveSugg page:
Here the "search by category" button does not work, because in the next step I will connect it to the data and thus only items belonging to this category will be displayed.
The "Offer price" button is also not working now and will be connected to the data in the next step.
I entered the data of the items manually just for the purpose of demonstration, in the next step the goal is for the items to be displayed in this way from the database.

*****I know that many students used the API, but after consulting with Naama, I realized that the next step on my website will be relatively complicated in terms of queries and there is no need to deal with the API either

*****I performed validation tests in both HTML and JS

*****I made an animation for the buttons

*****In JS there are functions both for validation and for using ACTIV to mark the page the user is currently on
